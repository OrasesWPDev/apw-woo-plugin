# Phase 1: Architecture Analysis Specification

## Overview
Comprehensive analysis of the existing APW WooCommerce Plugin codebase to identify architectural issues, code quality problems, and areas requiring refactoring.

## Analysis Methodology

### 1.1 Codebase Structure Analysis

#### File Organization Assessment
```bash
# Generate file structure report
find . -name "*.php" -type f | head -20
find . -name "*functions*.php" -type f
find . -name "class-*.php" -type f
```

#### File Size Analysis
```bash
# Identify large files that may need refactoring
find . -name "*.php" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -nr | head -10
```

#### Expected Findings
- **Main Plugin File**: `apw-woo-plugin.php` (~1087 lines) - **BLOATED**
- **Function Files**: 10+ separate function files with overlapping responsibilities
- **Class Files**: Mixed with function files, poor organization
- **Template Files**: Scattered across multiple directories

### 1.2 Architectural Issues Identification

#### 1.2.1 Overlapping Responsibilities Analysis

**Target Files for Analysis**:
```
includes/apw-woo-account-functions.php
includes/apw-woo-cart-indicator-functions.php
includes/apw-woo-checkout-fields-functions.php
includes/apw-woo-cross-sells-functions.php
includes/apw-woo-dynamic-pricing-functions.php
includes/apw-woo-intuit-payment-functions.php
includes/apw-woo-product-addons-functions.php
includes/apw-woo-recurring-billing-functions.php
includes/apw-woo-shipping-functions.php
includes/apw-woo-tabs-functions.php
```

**Analysis Criteria**:
- [ ] Duplicate validation logic across files
- [ ] Repeated WooCommerce hook registrations
- [ ] Similar error handling patterns
- [ ] Redundant utility functions
- [ ] Overlapping debugging code

#### 1.2.2 Main Plugin File Issues

**Analysis Focus**: `apw-woo-plugin.php`

**Expected Problems**:
1. **Mixed Concerns** (lines 1-50):
   - Plugin metadata
   - Constants definition
   - Dependency checking
   - Helper functions

2. **Bloated Function Definitions** (lines 50-400):
   - FAQ helper functions
   - Logging functionality
   - File management
   - Template system

3. **Complex Initialization** (lines 700-900):
   - Multiple initialization functions
   - Dependency chains
   - Hook registrations

4. **Testing and Debug Code** (lines 1000+):
   - Debug utilities
   - Performance tracking
   - Development helpers

#### 1.2.3 Code Duplication Analysis

**Search Patterns**:
```bash
# Find duplicate function patterns
grep -r "function apw_woo_" includes/ | cut -d: -f2 | sort
grep -r "add_action\|add_filter" includes/ | wc -l
grep -r "apw_woo_log" includes/ | wc -l
grep -r "APW_WOO_DEBUG_MODE" includes/ | wc -l
```

**Expected Duplications**:
- Logging function calls
- Debug mode checks
- Product validation logic
- Error handling patterns
- Hook registration patterns

### 1.3 Separation of Concerns Issues

#### 1.3.1 Business Logic vs Presentation

**Analysis Areas**:
- Template loading mixed with business logic
- HTML generation in business functions
- CSS/JS enqueueing scattered across files
- Database operations mixed with display logic

#### 1.3.2 Data Access Patterns

**Issues to Identify**:
- Direct `$_POST`/`$_GET` access without sanitization
- WooCommerce object manipulation without abstraction
- Database queries mixed with presentation logic
- Session management scattered across files

### 1.4 Code Quality Assessment

#### 1.4.1 Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis

**High-Complexity Functions to Analyze**:
- `apw_woo_init()` - Main initialization
- `apw_woo_autoload_files()` - File loading
- Payment processing functions
- Dynamic pricing calculations

**Complexity Indicators**:
- Nested conditionals >3 levels deep
- Functions >50 lines
- Multiple return points
- Complex parameter lists

#### 1.4.2 Coding Standards Violations

**Check Areas**:
```bash
# WordPress Coding Standards violations
grep -r "function [a-zA-Z_]* *(" includes/ | grep -v "function apw_woo_"
grep -r "class [A-Za-z_]* *{" includes/ | grep -v "class APW_"
grep -r "echo\|print" includes/
```

**Expected Issues**:
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Missing documentation blocks
- Improper indentation
- Mixed quote styles

### 1.5 Dependencies and Integration Issues

#### 1.5.1 Third-Party Plugin Dependencies

**Analysis Points**:
- WooCommerce integration patterns
- ACF field management approach
- Dynamic Pricing plugin integration
- Product Add-ons plugin integration
- Intuit payment gateway integration

#### 1.5.2 Hardcoded Values Analysis

**Search for Issues**:
```bash
# Find hardcoded values
grep -r "https://" includes/ | grep -v "example\|placeholder"
grep -r "github_pat_" . || echo "No hardcoded tokens found"
grep -r "3%" includes/
grep -r "\$[0-9]" includes/
```

**Expected Problems**:
- Hardcoded URLs
- Magic numbers in calculations
- Fixed percentages and fees
- Environment-specific paths

echo ""

echo "=== Function Analysis ==="
echo "Total functions: $(grep -r "^function " includes/ | wc -l)"
echo "APW functions: $(grep -r "^function apw_woo_" includes/ | wc -l)"
echo "Hook registrations: $(grep -r "add_action\|add_filter" includes/ | wc -l)"
echo ""

echo "=== Code Quality Indicators ==="

echo "Direct echoes: $(grep -r "echo\|print" includes/ | wc -l)"
echo "TODO comments: $(grep -ri "todo\|fixme\|hack" includes/ | wc -l)"
```

### 1.8 Architecture Violation Examples

#### Example 1: Mixed Concerns in Main File
```php
// VIOLATION: Business logic mixed with initialization
function apw_woo_init() {
    // Setup (good)
    apw_woo_setup_logs();
    
    // Business logic (should be in service)
    if (!apw_woo_verify_dependencies()) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Template logic (should be in template service)
    apw_woo_define_faq_field_structure();
    
    // File system operations (should be in loader)
    apw_woo_autoload_files();
}
```

#### Example 2: Duplicate Validation Patterns
```php
// VIOLATION: Same pattern in multiple files
// File 1: apw-woo-dynamic-pricing-functions.php
if (!$product_id) {
    if (APW_WOO_DEBUG_MODE) {
        apw_woo_log('Invalid product passed to function');
    }
    return array();
}

// File 2: apw-woo-product-addons-functions.php  
if (!$product_id) {
    if (APW_WOO_DEBUG_MODE) {
        apw_woo_log('Invalid product passed to function');
    }
    return array();
}
```
